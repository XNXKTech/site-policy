The universe of policies and procedures that govern the use of the XNXK applications operated by Chengdu Virtual Star Technology Co., Ltd ("XNXK"), including the official XNXK website (https://xnxk.com/ ), the WeChat and Alipay applets that XNXK is registered to operate and other methods or platforms officially approved by XNXK ("XNXK Applications"). open-sourced for your use and inspiration. We created this repository as a place for people to fork, contribute to, and provide feedback on our policies. While this is our official repo of open-sourced policies, it may not reflect the exact policies that are live on XNXK because this site is updated separately from the XNXK Applications.
